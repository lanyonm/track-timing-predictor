# Implementation Plan: Racer Schedule Lookup

**Branch**: `001-racer-schedule-lookup` | **Date**: 2026-03-14 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-racer-schedule-lookup/spec.md`

## Summary

Allow a racer to enter their name on a competition schedule page and see their events highlighted with heat-specific predicted start times. Names are parsed from existing start list pages, matched using case-insensitive order-independent full-name comparison, persisted via cookie for returning users, and encoded in the URL for sharing. No new dependencies required — extends existing parsing, prediction, and template infrastructure.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Pydantic, httpx, Jinja2, BeautifulSoup (all existing)
**Storage**: In-memory caches (existing pattern) — no database changes
**Testing**: pytest with fixture-based tests, SQLite isolation via conftest.py
**Target Platform**: Lambda + Function URL (Docker/ECR), local dev via uvicorn
**Project Type**: Web service (server-rendered HTML with HTMX enhancement)
**Performance Goals**: Name matching adds ≤1s to schedule load (SC-006); personalized view within 5s (SC-001)
**Constraints**: All routes GET-only (CloudFront OAC); Lambda 60s timeout / 512MB memory; mobile-first (320px+, 200% zoom)
**Scale/Scope**: Single-competition view, ~60 events per competition, ~5-30 riders per start list

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| I. Graceful Degradation | PASS | Feature is additive — schedule works without name input. Missing start lists shown as "unavailable" (FR-010). No JS required for core flow (GET form). |
| II. Testable Without External Dependencies | PASS | Rider parsing testable with plain-text fixtures. Name matching is pure logic. Route tests use TestClient. |
| III. Separation of Concerns | PASS | Parser extracts riders, predictor matches and computes timing, routes handle cookie/URL, templates render. No cross-boundary leakage. |
| IV. Minimal Dependencies | PASS | No new dependencies. Uses only `base64` from stdlib plus existing packages. |
| V. Operability | PASS | No new infrastructure. Logging can include matched rider count per request. |
| VI. Cost-Aware Growth | PASS | No new AWS services. Start list pages already fetched; parsing extends existing work. In-memory cache, no additional storage. |
| VII. Prediction Integrity | PASS | Per-heat timing derived from existing per_heat_duration — no new prediction source. SC-003 ensures no additional error. |
| VIII. Security & Data Minimization | JUSTIFIED | Racer name cookie stores voluntarily-entered public data (names on tracktiming.live). Cookie is httponly/secure/samesite. See Complexity Tracking. |

**POST-DESIGN RE-CHECK**: All gates remain satisfied. Name cookie is the only tension point with Principle VIII, justified and tracked below.

**Structure Decision**: Existing single-project layout. All changes are extensions to existing modules — no new files except test additions. This follows the established pattern where each module has a single responsibility.

## UI Design Decisions

Visual mockup at `docs/ui-recommendations-mockup.html` is the authoritative reference for all UI changes. Key decisions:

**Two-signal design**: Blue left border (`4px solid #1a73e8`) signals racer identity; background color signals event status. These are independent — a racer-matched active event has blue border + amber background, so both signals are visible simultaneously.

**Heat badge**: Solid blue pill (`background: #1a73e8; color: #fff`) inline after the event name. Multi-heat events display "Heat N"; single-heat events display "Racing". High contrast for prominence.

**Heat time placement**: "Your heat: HH:MM" appears on its own line below the duration value in the Est. Duration column (not in the Predicted Start column). The event-level predicted start remains unchanged so the racer can see both the event start and their specific heat start.

**State interaction rules**:
- `.racer-match`: blue border + blue tint bg (`#e8f0fe`)
- `.racer-match.active`: blue border + amber bg (`#fff3cd` preserved)
- `.racer-match.status-completed`: blue border + blue tint bg + opacity 0.45 on cell content (not row, so border retains full contrast) + line-through
- `.racer-match.status-upcoming`: blue border + blue tint bg (overrides green)
- All rules apply identically on desktop and mobile (4px border width matches existing mobile borders)

**Action links**: Always preserved on all rows regardless of racer-match status (FR-014). Button links have `margin: 0 4px 4px 0` for vertical breathing room when stacking.

**Messaging hierarchy** (FR-010): Four states with two styling tiers. **Blue info** (`#dce8fc`): success message ("Found N events") with a status line — "Racing now: [event], Heat N" (time omitted — event already underway) when the nearest matched event is active, or "Your next race: [event], Heat N at HH:MM" when it's upcoming (active takes priority; omitted when all matched events are completed). **Amber warning** (`#fff3cd`): no-match warning (only when start lists exist to search), missing-start-lists warning, and no-data warning (all start lists missing — suppresses misleading "no matches"). Success message provides immediate feedback so the racer doesn't have to scan the entire schedule; the "Racing now" / "Your next race" line directly answers the at-track question.

**Session auto-open** (FR-015): When a racer name is active, sessions containing matched events stay open even if complete. `SessionPrediction.has_racer_match` drives this.

**Form UX**: Button label is "Highlight" (not "Find"). A `<small>` hint below the input reads "Enter your full name as shown on the start list" to prevent single-name or partial entries. Redirect includes `#schedule-container` fragment for scroll-to-content (FR-016).

**Accessibility**: `.racer-match` rows include `aria-label="Your event"`. Message elements use `role="status"` for screen reader live region announcements.

## Naming Convention

"Racer" is the user-facing/UI term (racer name, racer match); "rider" is the code/data model term (RiderEntry, RiderMatch). Both refer to the same concept — a competitor in a start list.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Principle VIII: `racer_name` cookie stores user-entered name | Required for returning-user auto-apply (FR-009, SC-007) — core multi-day competition UX. Names are publicly available on tracktiming.live. Cookie is httponly/secure/samesite. | No persistence: user re-enters name every visit, fails US4. localStorage: not server-accessible, breaks HTMX model. Session-only: doesn't survive browser close, fails multi-day use case. |
| Principle III SHOULD: `_resolve_racer_name` as plain helper | Function combines query param + cookie resolution with racer-specific semantics — not a reusable cross-cutting concern. Called from exactly 2 routes. | `Depends()` injectable: adds abstraction for single-use logic, no testability benefit. |
